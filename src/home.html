            <h3>
                    The trip lasted roughly three weeks, we first landed in London and stayed there for roughly a week. Our second stop was Geneva, Switzerland where we stayed for roughly 4 days.
                This led us to the first place in France, Nice. We stayed in Nice for roughly 2 days before we were off to Paris. Our final destination, and leaving point was Paris which Maddie and I spent 3 days.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                Overall, the trip consisted of great food, beautiful scenery, and good company. Returning had all of us looking at our next means to go back. With something just so mezmerizing about something
                that is foreign to you, it all just seems cooler.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                We hope to delve deeper into Europe in the future, but for now all we have are these memories. So sit back and enjoy some of the imagery and stories from Europe 2023.
